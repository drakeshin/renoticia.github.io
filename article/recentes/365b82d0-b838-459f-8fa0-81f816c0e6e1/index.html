<p class="has-text-align-none">Valve won’t talk <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2">about a Steam Deck 2</a>. It probably wants to keep the attention on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">just-announced living room console</a>, comfy new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">controller</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Arm-based headset</a> instead. But now that the company is preparing to sell an Arm headset, one that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame">even run Android apps</a>, there’s an obvious question. Is Arm a one-off experiment for Valve, or might it power future SteamOS hardware?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais makes it sound like the sky’s the limit. I don’t want to oversell what he said — he was excited about the <em>potential</em>, not any specific devices, and you’ll see that in more context when we publish the interview later this week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when I ask whether he thinks there’ll be other SteamOS devices with Arm chips, he says the answer is yes, and that he’s excited about it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think that it paves the way for a bunch of different, maybe ultraportables, maybe more powerful laptops being Arm-based,” he begins. “Handhelds, there’s a lot of potential for Arm, of course, and one might see desktop chips as well at some point in the Arm world.” I immediately think about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678000/nvidia-arm-gaming-laptop-mediatek-alienware">Nvidia reportedly has an Arm-powered gaming laptop coming</a>, and how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785068/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-x2-elite-and-extreme-for-windows-pcs#:~:text=Razer%E2%80%99s%20Min%2DLiang%20Tan">Razer showed up</a> at Qualcomm’s last coming-out party for laptop chips.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’ll keep greasing the wheels, so to speak, so that SteamOS can work on a wider variety of Arm devices, but also so that the catalog becomes more reliable there in terms of compatibility and performance,” says Griffais.</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Griffais tells me that companies are already reaching out to Valve about handhelds, and I happen to know that one of them, OneNetbook, has recently been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen#:~:text=He%20says%20the%20company%20would%20find%20it%20%E2%80%9Cvery%20interesting%E2%80%9D%20to%20discuss%20a%20potential%20SteamOS%20handheld.">experimenting with (and selling) powerful handheld-grade Arm chips</a>, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But again, Valve isn’t talking about the Steam Deck 2 today, and I get the sense that Griffais may not see enough power in Arm handheld chips <em>just</em> <em>yet</em> — at least not for a “generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life” like Valve promised for the Steam Deck’s successor. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When you get into lower power, anything lower than Steam Deck, I think you’ll find that there’s an Arm chip that maybe is competitive with x86 offerings in that segment,” he tells me earlier in our conversation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I like to imagine Griffais was winking when he said “anything lower than Steam Deck,” but his camera was off.</p>
