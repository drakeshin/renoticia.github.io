<p class="has-text-align-none">Valve has just announced its biggest hardware push that it’s arguably ever made — a living room game console called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">the Steam Machine</a>, a headset called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">the Steam Frame</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">long-awaited sequel</a> to its Steam Controller <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022">it hinted about three years back</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Valve won’t say the first word about its next gaming handheld, the Steam Deck 2. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Steam Deck is not what we’re here to talk about today,” Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais told us at the very beginning of our briefing. “It’s sort of related but not really,” he said, before launching into a discussion of how the Steam Deck’s learnings underpinned every new product that it’s announcing today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company wouldn’t tell us if the new drift-resistant TMR joysticks it’s introducing in the Steam Controller and Steam Frame’s wands will make it into a future Steam Deck, either. “We’re always thinking about Steam Deck and ways to improve it in the future,” says Valve hardware engineer Steve Cardinali when I ask. (He also says Valve currently has no plans to offer the TMR joysticks as a drop-in module for the original Deck.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Valve has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23322516/valve-steam-deck-long-term-vision-digital-book-ebook-booklet">repeatedly confirmed</a> that the Steam Deck will have sequels, the company’s also repeatedly been clear that it’s in no hurry to bring them to market. Since 2022, Griffais <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022">has consistently</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">told us</a> that Valve wants to see a significant leap in performance and efficiency before it takes the plunge. “We really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck,” is how Valve’s Lawrence Yang concisely <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/">reiterated it to <em>Reviews.org</em></a> in 2024.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question now is: Will Valve find that leap in performance and efficiency from x86? Because while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview#:~:text=But%20Coomer%20did%20light%20up">Valve initially thought</a> its standalone VR headset might run on the existing Steam Deck’s chip, the company just announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">the Steam Frame</a> with an Arm processor instead — using emulation to let it play some Windows games locally on the headset. Griffais tells me he thinks Arm has “a lot of potential” in future handhelds someday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Valve tells us the Frame has a lower performance target than the nearly four-year-old Steam Deck, so it would need a far more potent Arm chip to power such a handheld. Qualcomm, in particular, has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631005/qualcomm-snapdragon-g3-gen-3-onexsugar-handheld-ayaneo-pocket">working on Arm chips for handhelds</a>, though, and one of its customers for the latest was even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cvery%20interesting%E2%80%9D%20to%20discuss%20a%20potential%20SteamOS%20handheld.">interested in discussing a possible SteamOS handheld</a> with Valve.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also possible Valve already found its next Steam Deck chip in AMD’s future roadmaps — like it did with the original Steam Deck — and is simply waiting for it to arrive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of that necessarily means you should expect&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Arm-based Steam Deck 2 just yet</a>, though.</p>
