<p>Hypixel Studios has officially purchased the license to <em>Hytale </em>from Riot Games, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hypixel-acquires-hytale-back-from-riot-games"><ins>according to a report by </ins><em><ins>Game Developer</ins></em></a>. This means that <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved"><ins>development will continue</ins></a> just months after <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-and-ends-development-of-hytale-190435047.html"><ins>Riot shut everything down</ins></a> and cancelled the project.</p>
<p>The developer is also rehiring 30 staffers that were laid off as part of the cancellation. We write so often about <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/eleven-percent-of-game-developers-were-laid-off-in-2024-according-to-gdc-survey-130003228.html"><ins>layoffs in the industry</ins></a>, so it&#39;s always a distinct treat to cover the opposite.</p>

<p>Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme calls this a &quot;new and exciting chapter&quot; for the game, which has been in development for nearly ten years. He says he is &quot;grateful to Riot Games for making this possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Riot Games, which is owned by the conglomerate Tencent, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/riot-buys-hypixel-studios-hytale-171845047.html"><ins>purchased Hypixel Studios back in 2020</ins></a> for an undisclosed sum. However, <em>Hytale</em> was riding high at that point. The game had attracted over 2.5 million signees for an upcoming beta and was supposed to be officially released in 2021.</p>
<p>Years passed, and still no <em>Hytale</em>. This eventually led to Riot canning the project entirely. &quot;After years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring <em>Hytale</em> to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise,&quot; <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale"><ins>an official post</ins></a> on the Hypixel website once read.</p>

<p>The studio hasn&#39;t disclosed how it got funding for this move, but Collins-Laflamme said that the founders are &quot;personally committed to funding for the next 10 years.&quot; Here&#39;s to hoping the game is actually playable by that point. To that end, the company does plan on announcing an early access release date in the near future.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Hytale</em> has had a long and challenging journey. It&#39;s taken longer than anyone hoped, and it&#39;s changed a lot along the way,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;This is not going to be easy. This is not going to be fast. This is not going to be perfect. But it&#39;s going to be ours. Built together: one feature at a time, one bug fix at a time, one mod at a time.&quot;</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Hytale</em> is a nifty-looking adventure game that can be described as an open world riff on <em>Minecraft</em>. It certainly looks like <em>Minecraft</em>, but it has a much bigger emphasis on action and RPG mechanics.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/hypixel-studios-buys-its-ip-from-riot-so-hytale-is-back-in-development-185040959.html?src=rss
