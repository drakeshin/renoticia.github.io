<p class="has-text-align-none">Black Friday often brings the best Apple deals of the year, but not everyone wants to spend their Thanksgiving weekend shopping online (or in person). Thankfully, if you want to get a head start, you don’t have to wait. As is typical, the early Black Friday deals are already beginning to trickle in, including some of the best deals we’ve seen all year on Apple devices like the latest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Effortless/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/">entry-level AirPods</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FWD6SKL6/">new M5-powered MacBook Pro</a>. Other Apple gadgets aren’t quite as steeply discounted, but some are discounted enough to be worth considering.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you want to avoid the holiday rush, we’ve gathered the best Apple deals you can get in the run-up to the main event. We’ve also included recent price history and our expectations for Black Friday proper, so you can decide whether to make your purchase now or hold out for a potentially better deal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="what-to-expect-on-black-friday">What to expect on Black Friday</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although we’re currently seeing a number of Apple products sitting at their lowest price to date, several of these deals could drop even lower as we get closer to Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Past deal history gives us a few clues about what to expect.&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Apple Watches: </strong>Apple’s latest-gen Apple Watches often hit their best prices to date during Black Friday. Last year, for instance, the Series 10 dropped to $329, while the second-gen SE fell to a mere $149 in its entry-level configuration. We anticipate that some of the last-gen models will be heavily discounted come the 28th, especially as retailers aim to offload remaining stock.</li>



<li><strong>AirPods: </strong>Historically, the newest AirPods receive their most significant discounts around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so it’s likely that we’ll see a deal on the newer AirPods Pro 3, which have only received a modest $10 discount thus far. Last-gen models like second-gen AirPods Pro with USB-C are also likely to receive steep discounts, though we don’t anticipate them dropping much further than their current low of $139. Current-gen models — including the AirPods 4 — could dip again, too, especially given they recently hit a new low of $84.99 ($45 off) before climbing back up.</li>



<li><strong>iPads and MacBooks: </strong>New iPad models, including the new M5 iPad Pro, may dip a little further in price next week, especially since they’ve recently been hovering just above their lowest prices to date. Previous sales indicate the current-gen base iPad could drop to as low as $279 on Black Friday, which would match its best price to date. As for laptops, both the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro are already sitting at a record low price, so there’s no telling whether we’ll see additional discounts.</li>



<li><strong>AirTags: </strong>Last year, you could pick up an individual AirTag for $19 or a four-pack for $69.99. However, Apple’s location trackers are already available for less than that, and there’s no indication they will drop further in price, given many Black Friday promos have already kicked off.</li>

While the Series 11 offers slightly longer battery life, a more efficient 5G modem, and a more scratch-resistant display, the Series 10 remains an excellent smartwatch. It features a large, wide-angle OLED display and the same S10 SiP chip found in the Series 11. It also supports FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection and offers the same hypertension notifications, courtesy of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/710780/watchos-26-preview-apple-intelligence-workout-buddy-smart-stack-wrist-flick">recent watchOS 26 update</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24246464/apple-watch-series-10-review-smartwatch-wearables">Read our review</a>.</li>



<li>You can buy the 40mm <strong>Apple Watch SE (second-gen)</strong> with GPS&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Detection/dp/B0DGJ736JM/">Amazon</a>&nbsp;starting at $159.99 ($90 off), which is $10 shy of the all-time low we saw during Black Friday last year. If you’re on a tight budget, the last-gen Apple Watch SE is still worth considering. It lacks some of Apple’s newer sensors and doesn’t offer an always-on display, but it remains relatively fast, given that it uses the same chipset as the Apple Watch Series 8. It also provides all the essentials, including daily activity and sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, fall and crash detection, and access to the newer Vitals app in watchOS 26.</li>

It also offers faster storage and a 10-core CPU / 10-core GPU that’s up to 3.5x faster at AI tasks. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/803349/apple-macbook-pro-14-m5-2025-review">Read our review.</a></div>

<li>The <strong>last-gen 16-inch MacBook Pro</strong> is still a powerhouse even if it runs on the older M4 Pro chip, and right now you can buy it with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-14%E2%80%91core-20%E2%80%91core/dp/B0DLHN4B38">$2,199 (about $300 off) at&nbsp;Amazon</a>, which is just a few dollars shy of its all-time low. Compared to the 14-inch last-gen model, it adds faster Thunderbolt 5 ports and a sharper 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam. The new M5-powered MacBook Pros don’t yet come in a 16-inch size, so if you want a larger display, this is your best bet. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks">Read our review of the 14-inch M4-powered MacBook Pro.</a></li>



<li>If you’re in the market for a desktop and don’t mind supplying your own keyboard and mouse, you can buy the <strong>M4 Mac Mini with an M4 processor</strong>, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $499 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLBTPDCS/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg1117awD__625928__________________google.com">Amazon</a>, which is one of its best prices to date. The desktop can handle everyday tasks with ease, along with some light gaming and 4K video editing. It can also run up to three displays simultaneously and offers a great port selection that includes three Thunderbolt 4 (USB4) ports, gigabit ethernet, HDMI, two 10Gbps USB-C (USB 3) ports, and a front-facing 3.5mm audio jack. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289730/apple-mac-mini-m4-review">Read our review.</a></li>
