<p>Meta has successfully avoided what was once the biggest existential threats to its company. A federal judge has <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/meta-wins-ftc-antitrust-trial-over-instagram-whatsapp-deals" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1">sided</a> with the social media company in a landmark antitrust case, ruling on Tuesday that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had not proven that Meta is a monopoly. </p><p>The FTC filed antitrust charges against Meta, then known as Facebook, <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-antitrust-ftc-48-states-194858668.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1">in 2020</a> during President Donald Trump&#39;s first term. The government had argued that by acquiring its one-time rivals, Instagram and WhatsApp, the company had hurt US consumers by stifling competition in the social media industry. Meta <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/ftcs-weak-case-against-meta-ignores-reality/" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1">had argued</a> that those services were only able to grow to the 1 billion-user apps because of its investment and had cited the rise of TikTok as proof that it continues to face strong competition.</p><p>On Tuesday, US District judge James Boasberg ruled in favor <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rww8JGP.20cc/v0" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1">of Meta</a>. &quot;Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The Court’s verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.&quot;</p><p>If the FTC had succeeded, it could have called for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. &quot;We are deeply disappointed in this decision,” the FTC’s  director of public affairs Joe Simonson said in a statement. “The deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg, who is currently facing articles of impeachment.  We are reviewing all our options.&quot; The FTC could still appeal the ruling, though it’s not clear if it plans to do so.</p><p>&quot;The Court&#39;s decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement. “Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America.&quot;</p><p>A number of current and former high-profile executives, including Adam Mosseri, Sheryl Sandberg, Kevin Systrom and Mark Zuckerberg <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/what-weve-learned-from-ftc-v-meta-antitrust-trial-162048138.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1">testified</a> during the weeks-long trial earlier this year. In his testimony, Zuckerberg spoke about the immense pressure Meta felt from TikTok, saying that Meta&#39;s growth had &quot;slowed down dramatically&quot; as TikTok became more popular.&nbsp;</p><p>It turns out that Meta&#39;s defense that TikTok and YouTube are major competitors to it helped sway Judge Boasberg. While the FTC&#39;s lawyers had tried to claim that Meta had a monopoly on &quot;personal social networking&quot; apps — a narrow group it said included Snapchat and the decentralized app MeWe — Boasberg was unable to ignore the dominance of TikTok and YouTube.</p><p>&quot;PSN [personal social networking] apps may have been a market unto themselves when the FTC filed this case in 2020 or when it approved Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014,&quot; he wrote. &quot;That is no longer the case. The Court ultimately finds that YouTube and TikTok belong in the product market, and they prevent Meta from holding a monopoly.&nbsp; Even if YouTube is out, including TikTok alone defeats the FTC’s case.&quot;</p><p><strong>Update, November 18, 20225, 12:08PM PT:</strong> Added a statement from the FTC.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-has-won-the-antitrust-case-that-could-have-forced-it-to-spin-off-instagram-and-whatsapp-184320742.html?src=rss
