<p>Each year, “<em>The Economist”</em> puts out an issue that is dedicated to what is coming in the year ahead.  As we approach 2026, &#8220;The World Ahead&#8221; edition seems like it could be possible, especially considering The Economist tends to be fairly accurate.</p>
<p><a href="https://endoftheamericandream.com/super-creepy-the-world-ahead-2026-magazine-cover-published-by-the-economist-shows-they-expect-war-pestilence-and-financial-collapse-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Snyder from the <em>End of the American Dream</em> wrote:</a> The reason why [The Economist is] so accurate is because the ultra-wealthy elite have an enormous amount of influence over the course of human events.</p>
<p>What immediately stood out was the pills littering the globe, surrounded by syringes jutting toward the sky like weapons. Others noticed the war images, such as a cargo ship being shot with an arrow.</p>
<p>As of Saturday, an outbreak of the Marburg virus has been confirmed <a title="in Ethiopia" href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/ethiopia-confirms-outbreak-of-deadly-marburg-virus-africa-cdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Ethiopia.</a> How bad could it get? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Trump is also suggesting that military strikes in Mexico and Colombia <a title="could be coming" href="https://www.themirror.com/news/politics/breaking-donald-trump-threatens-bomb-1510517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could be coming</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>President Trump hinted at being open to sending military strikes to Mexico and Colombia in order to stop drugs on Monday, sending chills across the region.</p>
<p>The president made the comments during a press conference on Monday as he hosted a meeting with FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) President Gianni Infantino and the White House task force on the 2026 World Cup at the Oval Office.</p>
<p>“Would I launch strikes on Mexico to stop drugs? It’s OK with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs. Mexico is…look I looked at Mexico City over the weekend. There’s some big problems over there. If we had to would we do there what we’ve done to the waterways? You know there is almost no drugs coming through our waterways anymore. Isn’t it down like 85%?” the president said. &#8211;<a href="https://www.themirror.com/news/politics/breaking-donald-trump-threatens-bomb-1510517" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Mirror</em></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Some pointed out what looks like paper currency falling everywhere, and our money is increasingly becoming worthless as rulers inflate and continue to steal from the public they pretend to protect.</p>
<p>As Snyder pointed out, &#8220;Obviously, they are trying to communicate something about the global economy, and it certainly isn’t good. Will 2026 be a year of financial collapse? We won’t have to wait too long to find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>What do you think? What stands out to you in the image? What will you be preparing for in 2026?</p>
