<p>&#8216;There was an attack on <a href="https://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/jin_yong">Jin Yong</a>’s writing in the Party newspaper, <em>Zhongguo Qingnian Bao</em>, by someone called Wang Shuo, which was a real hatchet job against his popularity with the young. Wang specifically called out <em>Demi-gods and Semi-Devils</em> for criticism, and said that it was unconscionably awful.</p>



<p>&#8216;He only read the first volume, which is to say, the events that we see in this <em>Battle Wizard</em> movie, and said that he had to finish it “while holding his nose” accusing Jin Yong of “making every single error that someone can make in writing fiction” including shunting his characters around through predictable obstacles like “pigs driven through a narrow alley.”</p>



<p>&#8216;So as you can perhaps already tell, it was a significant hatchet job, and went on and on about how Jin Yong’s books were so terrible, and so popular, that as far as Wang could see there was only one possible explanation, which was that people needed escapism from their modern lives, and that <a href="https://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/wuxia">wuxia </a>fiction served as, what he called, a “head massage.”</p>



<p>&#8216;Unfortunately, Wang Shuo seemed to have forgotten the golden rule of literary criticism, which is not to pick a fight with someone who writes for a living, because only a few weeks later, Jin Yong published an absolutely rip-roaring response of his own in the <em>Wenhui Bao</em> newspaper in Shanghai.</p>



<p>&#8216;He said that he was always pleased to read criticism of his work, and that he basically agreed that his fiction was over-rated, and he was sorry for all the awards it had won, and all the copies that it sold, and the millions of people who loved reading it. And, you know, it was probably a sign of terrible times that these books that Wang Shuo hated so much were the subject of a graduate course at Beijing University, and it was surely of great embarassment that American academics had staged a whole conference on his fiction in Colorado.</p>



<p>&#8216;And he went on to say that it was kind of weird that Wang Shuo said he could barely finish the first of seven volumes, because the story actually only had five volumes, so it sounded to him that he was reading an illegal pirate edition, or maybe even a completely different book. But whatever, he was very grateful for millions of enthusiastic readers, and one troll whining about it didn’t bother him much.&#8217;</p>
