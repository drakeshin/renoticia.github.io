<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s the most wonderful time of the year, but it can also be the most exhausting. Between hunting for gifts and getting the house ready for guests, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Thankfully, we’re already seeing steep discounts on robot vacuums ahead of Black Friday, which can at least make the cleaning part feel a little more manageable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This year, some of the best midrange models — including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPFBBHP4/">Eufy’s X10 Pro Omni</a> — have fallen to budget robovac pricing, meaning you can pick up a self-emptying dock or nab a robovac with high-end features like AI obstacle detection for well under $500. A few premium picks<span>, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZXFNVQ2/" target="_blank">Ecovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DREAME-Detangling-Carpet-Protecting-Self-Empty-Self-Cleaning/dp/B0F9PC3L11?th=1" target="_blank">Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller Complete,</a></span> have also fallen to their lowest prices to date, allowing you to take advantage of self-cleaning mops, robotic arms, and other handy add-ons without having to spend north of $1,000.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals on our favorite bots, from basic models that get the job done to powerful cleaning machines that can make the entire experience (almost) hands-free.</p>

<li>The <strong>Eufy X10 Pro Omni</strong>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner">our favorite midrange robot vacuum / mop</a>, is available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPFBBHP4/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/eufy-x10-pro-omni-wi-fi-connected-robot-vacuum-mop-with-self-washing-and-self-drying-auto-empty-station-black/JJ858R7TFX/sku/6576392">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.eufy.com/products/t2351111/">Eufy</a> (with promo code&nbsp;<strong>WS24T2351</strong>) for $499.99 ($400 off), matching its best price to date. The X10 Pro Omni uses dual oscillating mop pads to thoroughly scrub your floors, and the included dock features heated mop drying to help prevent unwanted odors from building up. The robovac performs especially well on carpet and tile, delivers 8,000Pa of suction power, and offers reliable AI-powered obstacle detection, which is a rare feature to find at this price. Plus, it comes with a dock that auto-empties, washes, and refills itself.</li>



<li><strong>Narwal’s&nbsp;Freo Z Ultra</strong>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/625409/best-robot-vacuum-mops?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=h5d&amp;utm_campaign=h_vg_00063&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23006543975&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9k5E7DOThrQvzbr5rIvgokbCXXOV&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAuIDJBhBoEiwAxhgyFtNbQTc5Id_Zgz-uzQWXmsdTO9Yrxd1AFrQnW-LO0Zb3dBcu90WHaxoCYJoQAvD_BwE">our No. 1 mopping vac for hard floors</a>, is on sale for an all-time low of $719.99 ($780 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NARWAL-Avoidance-Real-Time-Decisions-Hot-Water/dp/B0D7HG8H24/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://us.narwal.com/products/narwal-freo-z-ultra-robot-vacuum-mop">Narwal’s online storefront</a>. It builds upon the Freo X Ultra — which is also on sale for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPLP422K/">$519.99 at Amazon</a> — with an auto-empty dock, better vacuuming with 12,000Pa of suction power, and improved obstacle avoidance thanks to a dual-camera system. It also includes oscillating mop pads that do a great job of scrubbing away dried-on messes, and the bot can even recognize different types of flooring and automatically adjust its pressure and the amount of humidity it delivers based on the type.</li>
</ul>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Roborock Q10 S5 Plus</h3>
<div class="product-description">The Roborock Q10 S5 Plus delivers 10,000Pa of suction power and features a sonic mop that scrubs 3,000 times per minute. It also comes with a 2.7-liter self-emptying dock that can store up to 70 days’ worth of debris, along with room-specific mapping, no-go zones, and customizable cleaning schedules.</div>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Roborock’s Saros 10R</strong> is on sale for $999.99 ($500 off) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Saros-10R-Zero-Tangling-Self-Emptying/dp/B0DHCJ571Z">at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-saros-10r">directly from Roborock</a>, which is a record low price. The pricey robovac uses an AdaptLift chassis to help it climb over high room transitions, and can even lift its mop pads out of the way when they’re not needed. It’s also exceptionally powerful, with 22,000Pa of suction, lidar navigation, and a vibrating mopping pad.</li>



<li>You can pick up <strong>Roborock’s Qrevo Curv</strong> for $799.99 ($800 off) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Qrevo-Curv-Zero-Tangling-Self-Emptying/dp/B0D81675BQ">at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-qrevo-curv">directly from Roborock</a>, which beats the robovac’s previous low by about $100. The Qrevo Curv is another robot that can climb stairs and move over room transitions up to 40mm high. It gets its name from its curved side brush — which helps prevent hair from tangling — and features 18,500Pa of suction power, in addition to a multifunctional dock and reactive AI obstacle avoidance via a built-in camera.</li>
</ul>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Dreame X40 Ultra</h3>
<div class="product-description">With a neat ability to remove and reattach its mop pads, the Dreame X40 solves the problem of vacuuming carpets (with 12,000Pa suction power) while also mopping hard floors. Its mops can also swing out and under low furniture, getting where most bots can’t reach.</div>
<figure class="product-image"><img width="300" height="225" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25509055/IMG_3249.JPG?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" /></figure>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Amazon Prime members can currently pick up the <strong>Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller Complete</strong> on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DREAME-Detangling-Carpet-Protecting-Self-Empty-Self-Cleaning/dp/B0F9PC3L11/">Amazon</a> for $899.99 ($700 off), which is a new low price. It stands out with a roller-style mopping system that rinses and cleans itself in real time, along with a massive 30,000Pa of suction power. You also get AI-powered obstacle avoidance and a mop that detects carpet and prevents it from getting wet.</li>



<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Dreame Matrix 10 Ultra</strong> is available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9P5PY1W/">Amazon</a> (for Prime members) and <a href="https://www.dreametech.com/products/matrix10-ultra-robot-vacuum">Dreame</a> for $1,399.99 ($600 off), which is the lowest price we’ve seen. Like the aforementioned Aqua10, it boasts 30,000Pa of suction power and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, but it adds a multi-mop switching dock that will automatically swap between nylon scrub pads, sponge pads, and heated mop pads depending on the surface. The dock also includes separate compartments with three cleaning solutions designed for pet odors, wood floors, and everyday messes.</li>
</ul>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Ecovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni</h3>
<div class="product-description">The Ecovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni features an extendable mop that can clean itself, just like its predecessor. However, it also features Ecovacs&#8217; Boosted Large-Airflow Suction Technology, which optimizes the airflow path from intake to exhaust, rather than relying solely on suction power. </div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/ecobeedebot.jpg?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" /></figure>

<li>The <strong>SwitchBot S10</strong> is currently on sale <a href="https://us.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-floor-cleaning-robot-s10">directly from SwitchBot</a> for $360 when you use coupon code<strong> BFCM70,</strong> down from $1,199.99 and just $40 shy of its all-time low. The Matter-compatible robovac works with all major smart home platforms and comes with self-cleaning rolling mops, which will dry themselves with hot air after use. It also delivers up to 6,500Pa of suction power and offers decent AI-powered obstacle avoidance, though in our experience, it wasn’t always reliable. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24144618/switchbot-s10-review-robot-vacuum">Read our review</a>.</li>



<li>You can buy the <strong>Eufy 11S Max</strong> for $139.99 ($100 off) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R295MLS/">at Amazon</a>, which isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen but still the best price we’ve seen this year. If you’re looking for a dirt-cheap, basic bump-and-go bot, the discontinued 11S Max is a solid option. You won’t get bells and whistles like self-emptying bins or AI-powered obstacle avoidance, but you do get 2,000Pa of suction power, easily replaceable parts, and quiet operation. It doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi, either, but you can still start and schedule cleanings with the onboard buttons or the included remote.</li>
