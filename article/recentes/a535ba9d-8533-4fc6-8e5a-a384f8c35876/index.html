"Media headlines suggesting some slowdown in EV sales are simply incorrect," writes the site Electrek, "and leave out the bigger picture that gas car sales actually are dropping..."



Over the course of
the last two years or so, sales of battery electric vehicles, while
continuing to grow, have posted lower year-over-year percentage
growth rates than they had in years prior. EV sales used to grow at
50%+ per year, but for the last couple years, they have grown closer
to ~25% per year. This alone is not particularly remarkable &mdash; it
is inevitable that any growing product or category will show slower
percentage growth rates as sales rise, particularly one that has been
growing at such a fast rate for so long. In some recent years, we
had even seen year-over-year
doublings in EV market share (though one of those was 2020-&gt;2021,
which was anomalous). To expect improvement at that level perpetually
would be close to impossible &mdash; after 3 years of doubling
market share from 2023's 18% number, EVs would account for more
than 100% of the global automotive market, which cannot happen... 

We have seen a global EV sales growth rate of 23% in the first 10
months of this year, according to a report just released by Rho
Motion (recently acquired by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence). That
includes a +32% bump in Europe, +22% bump in China, +4% in North
America, and a big +48% bump in the "rest of the world." Notably,
this 23% global growth rate is higher than last year's YTD growth
rate, which was 22%
at this time... 

In covering these trends, some journalists have attempted to use
the less-wrong phrase "slower growth," showing that EV sales are
still growing, but at a lower percentage change than previously seen.
 But for the first ten months of this year, that isn't true &mdash; EV
sales are up more in 2025 than in 2024 by a percentage basis. They
are also up in raw sales numbers &mdash; in 2024, EV
sales grew by a larger number than in 2023. And the same is true
so far in 2025. Going back to 2023, 10.7 million EVs were sold
globally in the first 10 months. Then in 2024, 13.3 million were
sold, a difference of 2.6 million. And so far in 2025, 16.5 million
EVs have sold, a difference of 3.2 million. Not only are the numbers
getting bigger, but the growth in unit sales is getting bigger as
well. 

Even in America, the
EV market "has increased so far this year, with 11.7%
US EV sales growth YTD."

In terms of US hybrid sales, much has been made of customers
"shifting from EVs to hybrids," which is also not the case.
Conventional gas-hybrid sales are
indeed up and plug-in hybrids, which have grown more slowly
than gas-hybrids/BEVs, have also shown some growth lately. But
gas-hybrid sales have not come at the cost of EV sales, rather at the
cost of gas-only car sales. 

Because that's
just the thing: the number of gas-only vehicles
being sold worldwide is a number that actually is falling.
That number continues to go down year over year. Sales of new
gas-powered cars are down by about
a quarter from their peak in 2017, and show no signs of
recovering... And yet, somehow, virtually every headline you read is
about the "EV sales slump," rather than the "gas-car sales
slump." The one you keep hearing about isn't happening,
but the one you rarely hear about is happening... No matter
what region of the world you're in, EV sales were up in the first
10 months of this year.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">
