<li>It’s that time of year when the sun rises late and sets early, so chances are you’ll be on the trail when it’s dark. If that’s the case, you’re going to need a headlamp. Luckily, the&nbsp;<strong>Black Diamond Spot 400 Headlamp</strong> is down to around $41.19 (about $13 off) at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rei.com/product/202774/black-diamond-spot-400-headlamp">REI</a> and <a href="https://www.backcountry.com/b/black-diamond-spot-400-headlamp">Backcountry</a>. The headlamp is a great, basic option that features a max output of 400 lumens, a red LED light, and an IPX8 rating, making it safe to use in the rain. It also features an integrated battery meter, which shows the percentage of power remaining, so you know when to replace the batteries before they run out at an inopportune time.</li>
