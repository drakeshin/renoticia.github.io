<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ll admit it, I thought AR glasses like the Xreal One were a joke when I first heard about them. But they clicked for me as a gamer when I realized they could be plugged into a Steam Deck or an iPad to have my own huge, private display no matter where I am. If you want to be fully immersed in your games and movies (without wearing a bulky VR headset), there are some great AR glasses on sale for their lowest prices ever for Black Friday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <strong>Xreal One glasses</strong> are packed with features and cost $399.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DNFFXG65">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/xreal-one-ar-glasses-w-x1-chip-147-fhd-120hz-display-w-sound-by-bose-for-iphone-16-15-steam-rog-ally-mac-pc-android-ios-black/CZTVG22G2K/sku/6637457">Best Buy</a>, which is $180 off the original price. This model will look unassuming on your face, save for the USB-C cable you’ll attach to its ear hook to connect your device. The One supports a fast 120Hz refresh rate at 1080p, and its Micro OLED screens provide excellent contrast. The arms of the glasses have built-in Bose-tuned speakers that pipe audio downwards into your ears.</p>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Xreal One AR glasses</h3>
<div class="product-description">The Xreal One AR glasses put the equivalent of a 120Hz 147-inch screen in front of your eyes. The glasses can be connected to a smartphone, computer, and some handheld gaming PCs via USB-C. The glasses mirror your gadget’s display, so you can use them as an external monitor when working in addition to gaming and watching movies.</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of my favorite features in the One, three degrees of freedom, lets you virtually anchor the screen in place so it’s not always moving with your head. If you’re in a car, train, or plane, this might be essential to use if watching screens makes your motion sickness worse. As for downsides, the One lacks a hardware-based myopia dial to account for nearsightedness. If the screens look blurry, you may need to get prescription lenses for them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If having myopia adjustments is crucial to you, I suggest checking out <strong>Viture’s Luma Pro glasses</strong>, which include the setting. You can get them in the regular size for $424.99 (typically around $500 outside of a sale) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Luma-Pro-Glasses-Adjustments/dp/B0FD8NP2DC">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/viture-luma-pro-xr-glasses-152-inches-1200p-ultra-sharp-display-1000-nits-52-degrees-fov-myopia-adjustments-regular-black/J3R84H925W">Best Buy</a>, or in a large size for $449, also at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Luma-Pro-Glasses-Adjustments/dp/B0FD8NP2DC">Amazon</a>. These have a bit more of a gamer-y look, which some may not like, but they’re similar to the Xreal One in both functions and specs. They boast a slightly sharper 1200p resolution with Micro OLED screens and up to a 120Hz refresh rate. Harman tuned their built-in speakers.</p>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Viture Luma Pro XR glasses</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We apparently can’t just have one set of AR glasses in 2025 that can do it all for under $500, though. The Viture model lacks the three degrees of freedom that the Xreal One includes. In other words, the screen’s image will move as you move your head. That’ll either be totally fine with you, or it’ll be a deal-breaker.</p>
