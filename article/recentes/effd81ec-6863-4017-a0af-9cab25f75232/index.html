<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s been over three years since we first caught glimpse of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/8/23341409/jeep-electric-suv-recon-wagoneer-s-avenger-release-date">Jeep’s Wrangler-esque Recon EV</a>, named after the automaker’s suspension-lifting package of off-roading options for its popular lineup of SUVs. Jeep originally pegged the Recon’s sales debut for 2023, but that obviously didn’t happen. And since then, there have been further delays, and even rumors that the Recon was DOA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Surprisingly, those rumors turned out to be false. The 2026 Jeep Recon is alive and well, and will go into production in early 2026, with initial launches planned for the US and Canada. Jeep says the Recon will churn out 650 horsepower, 620lb-ft of torque, and a modest range of 250 miles. And with a starting price of $66,995 (including destination charge), it will slot below <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24166498/jeep-wagoneer-s-ev-price-photos-specs-range">the automaker’s brawnier, pricier Wagoneer S</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But will anyone shell out for an electric Wrangler facsimile that costs over double the price of a normal Wrangler? When it does go on sale, the Recon will likely confront a lot of the same headwinds as the Wagoneer S, and frankly the rest of Jeep’s lineup, which has been struggling to find buyers in recent years amid soaring costs and over-reliance on big, expensive SUVs. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/jeep-recon-wrangler-grand-wagoneer.html">But Jeep thinks its due for a comeback</a> — its recent sales quarter showed improving sales, while the rest of Stellantis was down — and that will include the all-electric Recon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“With the Jeep Recon, we’re proving that electrification isn’t just compatible with off-road excellence, it can elevate it, delivering instant torque, precision control and a quieter, more connected driving experience that’s uniquely Jeep,” CEO Bob Broderdorf said in a statement. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Naturally, Jeep is leaning on off-roading to help make its sales pitch. When it comes out, the Recon will be the only EV in the automaker’s lineup to earn the Trail Rated badge, which is awarded to vehicles that pass rigorous tests around traction, water fording, maneuverability, articulation, and ground clearance. (Of course, Jeep only has two fully electric vehicles, so its not that big of a distinction.) The Recon will come with Jeep’s Selec-Terrain traction management system, as well as e-locker axle technology, under-body protection, tow hooks, and off-road tires.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What about the battery, which sits low in the Recon’s floor? Will all that rock climbing or river fording damage the sensitive cells within? Not according to Jeep, which insists the 100kWh, 400-volt pack is throughly ensconced in a “full suite of sturdy, high-strength steel underbody shields.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Recon’s suspension includes a short-long arm up front and an integral link in the rear. On the standard 33-inch tires with the Moab trim, ground clearance is about 9.1 inches. And off-road specs feature 33.8-degree approach angle, 33.1-degree departure angle, and 23.3-degree breakover angle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like all good Wranglers, the Recon will also allow for the doors and the quarter rear-windshield glass to be fully removed —&nbsp;“No tools required,” Jeep says. No other electric SUVs currently allow for removable doors, not even the Jeep-aping Scout Traveler and Terra EVs, so that could certainly help the Recon distinguish itself. (Slate Auto’s first electric truck could include removable doors if it ever goes into production.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Recon features front and rear 250kW electric drive modules (EDM), each of which is comprised of an electric motor, gearing, and power electronics to deliver standard four-by-four propulsion and instant torque on demand.  The front EDM uses an 11:1 final drive ratio in an open differential design, which Jeep claims will help the drive quality feel very balanced. And the front axle includes automatic disconnects at each wheel end to help “optimize energy use and range during typical on-road driving conditions when rear-drive propulsion is more efficient,” the company says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That sense of customizability continues inside the Recon, where you’ll find modular door panels with removable elastic straps and interchangeable cargo configurations. The rear cargo space, with the second row folded, allows for 65.9 cubic-feet of space, while the frunk has a modest 3.0 cubic-feet, enough for a carry-on suitcase.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 12.3-inch drive cluster is all-new to Jeep, as well as the 14.5-inch central touchscreen in landscape orientation, which the automaker says is “the largest singular usable digital screen space ever offered in a Jeep vehicle.” And while the heating and cooling functions are digitally controlled through the screen, there is a physical volume knob. Still, Jeep touts its “sleek, buttonless design” that it claims “blends futuristic aesthetics with practical usability.” The infotainment runs on Stellantis’ Uconnect 5 operating system, and includes exclusive apps like Jeep’s Trails Offroad, a guide to trails across the US and Canada, with pitch and roll mapping. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, the Recon was originally supposed to arrive in 2024 —&nbsp;and its a shame that Stellantis couldn’t hold to that schedule. It could have benefited from the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, which could have helped take some of the bite out of that sticker price. Still, its a minor miracle the Recon survived the shakeup at Stellantis, in which Carlos Tavares was replaced as CEO by Antonio Filosa, who headed Jeep under Tavares’ leadership. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/31/24168663/jeep-electric-25000-ceo-antonio-filosa-interview">When I interviewed Filosa last year at the Wagoneer S launch</a>, he claimed that Jeep would eventually produce a $25,000 electric Jeep. The Recon is not that, but it’s a step toward a future where a more affordable model could be possible. </p>
